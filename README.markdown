CSS Grid structure
==================

A simple grid structure for building stable pixel-width layouts.


Two approaches:

* The content areas define the width
* The width is entirely implemented with grids


Two types of grid elements:

* Grid blocks for containing content
* Grid containers for containing other grid blocks
